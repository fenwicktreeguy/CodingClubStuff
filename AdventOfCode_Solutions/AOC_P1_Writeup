For the solution, the basis is being able to take input through a BufferedReader with the following syntax

BufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt")), where "file.txt" is the file you are reading input from

The first part of the problem asks us to take input of a list of numbers and for each number, we divide the number by 3, add 2, and then take that result and sum 
it to a separate variable

Ex. [12,6,4] -> [2,0,-1] -> 2 + 0 + -1 = 1

We can implement this by taking input into an array( int[] array = new int[size], where size is some value ), and apply the operations to it using a for loop
(for(int i = 0; i < N; i++))

This will give us an answer in relatively little time.

For part 2, we are asked to not just apply the operation of dividing by 3, subtracting by 2 just once, but multiple times (until the value becomes < 0)

We do this using something called a while loop, which functionally works by doing:

while(condition){
  run something in here
}

and while the condition is true, the while loop will run. For us, the condition is if the value is less than 0. 

Combining this, and the previous for loop over the data, will give us the answer as well.
